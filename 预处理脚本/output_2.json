The load absorbed comprises the load absorbed by frictionaleffects and the load absorbed by the power-absorption device.\nThe dynamometer is brought into operation beyond the range of test speeds. Thedevice used for starting up the dynamometer is then disconnected: the rotationalspeed of the driven roller decreases.\nThe kinetic energy of the rollers is dissipated by the power-absorption unit and bythe frictional effects. This method disregards variations in the roller's internalfrictional effects caused by rollers with or without the vehicle. The frictional effectsof the rear roller shall be disregarded when the roller is free.\n2.2.Calibration of the load indicator to 80 km/h as a function of the load absorbed. The following procedure shall be used (see also Figure 2/1):\n2.2.1.Measure the rotational speed of the roller if this has not already been done. A fifth wheel, a revolution counter or some other method may be used.\n2.2.2.Place the vehicle on the dynamometer or devise some other method of starting-up the dynamometer.\n2.2.3.Use the flywheel or any other system of inertia simulation for the particular inertia class to be used.\nE/ECE/TRANS/505 Regulation No.83 page 119 Annex 2 – Appendix 1 Figure 2/1 Diagram illustrating the power absorbed by the chassis dynamometer Ş = F = a + b · V2 Ƴ  = (a + b V2) - 0.1 · F80 ® = (a + b · V2) + 0.1 · F80\n2.2.4.Bring the dynamometer to a speed of 80 km/h.\n2.2.5.Note the load indicated Fi (N)\n2.2.6.Bring the dynamometer to a speed of 90 km/h.\n2.2.7.Disconnect the device used to start-up the dynamometer.\n2.2.8.Note the time taken by the dynamometer to pass from a speed of 85 km/h to a speed of 75 km/h.\n2.2.9.Set the power-absorption device at a different level.\n2.2.10.The requirements of paragraphs 2.2.4. to 2.2.9. shall be repeated sufficiently often to cover the range of loads used.\n2.2.11.Calculate the load absorbed using the formula: where:\nF= load absorbed (N) Mi = equivalent inertia in kg (excluding the inertial effects ofthe free rear roller)Ț V = Speed deviation in m/s ( 10 km/h = 2.775 m/s)t = time taken by the roller to pass from 85 km/h to 75 km/h.\nFigure 2/2 shows the load indicated at 80 km/h in terms of load absorbed at 80 km/h.\nFigure 2/2 Load indicated at 80 km/h in terms of load absorbed at 80 km/h\n2.2.13.The requirements of paragraphs 2.2.3. to 2.2.12. above shall be repeated for all inertia classes to be used.\n2.3.Calibration of the load indicator as a function of the absorbed load for other speeds.

For each run, read  vacuum level at one second intervals, calculatemean vacuum and standard deviation (s).  This calculation shall consist of no lessthan 10 readings of vacuum.\n3.1.4.2.The standard deviation must not exceed 10 per cent of the mean (v)  for each run.\n3.1.4.3.Calculate the mean value for the six runs (three runs in each direction).\n3.1.5.Dynamometer setting\n3.1.5.1.Preparation Perform the operations specified in paragraphs 5.1.2.2.1. to 5.1.2.2.4. ofAppendix 3 to this annex.\n3.1.5.2.Load setting After warm-up, drive the vehicle at a steady speed of 80 km/h and adjustdynamometer load to reproduce the vacuum reading (v) obtained in accordancewith paragraph 3.1.4.3. above.

The nominal concentration of the calibration gasof the highest concentration shall be not less than 80 per cent of the full scale.\n1.3.The calibration curve is calculated by the least squares method.  If the resulting polynomial degree is greater than 3, the number of calibration points shall be atleast equal to this polynomial degree plus 2.\n1.4.The calibration curve shall not differ by more than $ 2 per cent from the nominal value of each calibration gas.\n1.5.Trace of the calibration curve From the trace of the calibration curve and the calibration points, it is possible toverify that the calibration has been carried out correctly. The different characteristicparameters of the analyser shall be indicated, particularly:\nthe scale,the sensitivity,the zero point,the date of carrying out the calibration.\n1.6.If it can be shown to the satisfaction of the technical service that alternative technology (e.g. computer, electronically controlled range switch, etc.) can giveequivalent accuracy, then these alternatives may be used.\n1.7.Verification of the calibration\n1.7.1.Each normally used operating range shall be checked prior to each analysis in accordance with the following:\n1.7.2.The calibration shall be checked by using a zero gas and a span gas whose nominal value is within 80-95 per cent of the supposed value to be analysed.\n1.7.3.If, for the two points considered, the value found does not differ by more than $ 5 per cent of the full scale from the theoretical value, the adjustment parametersmay be modified. Should this not be the case, a new calibration curve shall beestablished in accordance with paragraph 1 of this appendix.\n1.7.4.After testing, zero gas and the same span gas are used for re-checking. The analysis is considered acceptable if the difference between the two measuring results is lessthan 2 per cent.\n2.CHECKING FOR FID HYDROCARBON RESPONSE\n2.1.Detector response optimisation The FID shall be adjusted, as specified by the instrument manufacturer. Propane inair should be used, to optimise the response, on the most common operating range.\n2.2.Calibration of the HC analyser The analyser should be calibrated using propane in air and purified synthetic air.\nSee paragraph 4.5.2. of Annex 4 (calibration and span gases).\nEstablish a calibration curve as described in paragraphs 1.1. to 1.5. of thisAppendix.\n2.3.Response factors of different hydrocarbons and recommended limits The response factor (Rf), for a particular hydrocarbon species is the ratio of theFID C1 reading to the gas cylinder concentration, expressed as ppm C1.\nThe concentration of the test gas shall be at a level to give a response ofapproximately 80 per cent of full-scale deflection, for the operating range. Theconcentration shall be known, to an accuracy of r 2 per cent in reference to agravimetric standard expressed in volume. In addition, the gas cylinder shall bepre-conditioned for 24 hours at a temperature between 293 K and 303 K (20 and 30°C).\nResponse factors should be determined when introducing an analyser into serviceand thereafter at major service intervals. The test gases to be used and therecommended response factors are:\nMethane and purified air: 1.00 < Rf < 1.15or   1.00 < Rf < 1.05 for NG fuelled vehiclesE/ECE/TRANS/505Regulation No.83page 153Annex 2 – Appendix 1Propylene and purified air: 0.90 < Rf < 1.00Toluene and purified air: 0.90 < Rf < 1.00Relative to a response factor (Rf) of 1.00 for propane and purified air.\n2.4.Oxygen interference check and recommended limits The response factor shall be determined as described in paragraph 2.3. above. Thetest gas to be used and recommended response factor range is:\nPropane and nitrogen: 0.95 < Rf < 1.05\n3.EFFICIENCY TEST OF THE NOx CONVERTER The efficiency of the converter used for the conversion of NO2 into NO is tested asfollows:\nUsing the test set up as shown in Figure 6/1 and the procedure described below, theefficiency of converters can be tested by means of an ozonator.\n3.1.Calibrate the analyzer in the most common operating range following the manufacturer's specifications using zero and span gas (the NO content of whichshall amount to about 80 per cent of the operating range and the NO2 concentrationof the gas mixture shall be less than 5 per cent of the NO concentration). The NOxanalyser shall be in the NO mode so that the span gas does not pass through theconverter. Record the indicated concentration.\n3.2.Via a T-fitting, oxygen or synthetic air is added continuously to the span gas flow until the concentration indicated is about 10 per cent less than the indicatedcalibration concentration given in paragraph 3.1. above.

The air flow-rate (Qs) at each test point is calculated from the flow-meter data usingthe manufacturer's prescribed method.\nCalculate values of the calibration coefficient for each test point:\nwhere:\nQs  = flow-rate in m3/min at 273.2 K and 101.33 kPa,Tv  = temperature at the venturi inlet (K),Pv  = absolute pressure at the venturi inlet (kPa).\nPlot  Kv as a function of venturi inlet pressure. For sonic flow, Kv  will have arelatively constant value. As pressure decreases (vacuum increases) the venturibecomes unchoked and Kv decreases. The resultant Kv changes are not permissible.\nFor a minimum of eight points in the critical region, calculate an average Kv andthe standard deviation.\nIf the standard deviation exceeds 0.3 per cent of the average Kv, take correctiveaction.\nAnnex 4 - Appendix 7 TOTAL SYSTEM VERIFICATION\n1.To comply with the requirements of paragraph 4.7. of Annex 4, the total accuracy of the CVS sampling system and analytical system shall be determined byintroducing a known mass of a pollutant gas into the system whilst it is beingoperated as if during a normal test and then analysing and calculating the pollutantmass according to the formulae in Appendix 8 to Annex 4 except that the density ofpropane shall be taken as 1.967 grams per litre at standard conditions. Thefollowing two techniques are known to give sufficient accuracy.\n2.Metering a constant flow of pure gas (CO or C3H8) using a critical flow orifice device\n2.1.A known quantity of pure gas (CO or C3H8) is fed into the CVS system through the calibrated critical orifice. If the inlet pressure is high enough, the flow-rate (q),which is adjusted by means of the critical flow orifice, is independent of orificeoutlet pressure (critical flow). If deviations exceeding 5 per cent occur, the cause ofthe malfunction shall be determined and corrected. The CVS system is operated asin an exhaust emission test for about 5 to 10 minutes. The gas collected in thesampling bag is analysed by the usual equipment and the results compared to theconcentration of the gas samples which was known beforehand.\n3.Metering a limited quantity of pure gas (CO or C3H8) by means of a gravimetric technique\n3.1.The following gravimetric procedure may be used to verify the CVS system. The weight of a small cylinder filled with either carbon monoxide or propane isdetermined with a precision of $ 0.01 g. For about 5 to 10 minutes, the CVSsystem is operated as in a normal exhaust emission test, while CO or propane isinjected into the system. The quantity of pure gas involved is determined by meansof differential weighing. The gas accumulated in the bag is then analysed by meansof the equipment normally used for exhaust-gas analysis. The results are thencompared to the concentration figures computed previously.\nE/ECE/TRANS/505 Regulation No.83 page 163 Annex 4 – Appendix 7 Annex 4 - Appendix 8 CALCULATION OF THE MASS EMISSIONS OF POLLUTANTS\n1.GENERAL PROVISIONS Mass emissions of gaseous pollutants shall be calculated by means of the followingequation:\nwhere:\nMi = mass emission of the pollutant i in grams per kilometer,Vmix  = volume of the diluted exhaust gas expressed in litres per test andcorrected to standard conditions (273.2 K and 101.33 kPa),Qi = density of the pollutant i in grams per litre at normal temperature andpressure (273.2 K and 101.33 kPa),kh = humidity correction factor used for the calculation of the massemissions of oxides of nitrogen.

Alternatively the volume of the test vehicle with theluggage compartment and windows open may be used instead of the 1.42 m3.\n2.1.3.The chamber shall be checked as in paragraph 2.3. below. If the propane mass does not correspond to the injected mass to within $ 2 per cent, then correctiveaction is required.\n2.2.Determination of chamber background emissions This operation determines that the chamber does not contain any materials thatemit significant amounts of hydrocarbons. The check shall be carried out at theenclosure's introduction to service, after any operations in the enclosure whichmay affect background emissions and at a frequency of at least once per year.\nE/ECE/TRANS/505 Regulation No.83 page 197 Annex 4 – Appendix 7\n2.2.1.Variable-volume enclosures may be operated in either latched or unlatched volume configuration, as described in paragraph 2.1.1. above, ambienttemperatures shall be maintained at 308 K $ 2 K. (35 $ 2 °C) [309 K $ 2 K(36 $ 2 °C)], throughout the 4-hour period mentioned below.\n2.2.2.Fixed volume enclosures shall be operated with the inlet and outlet flow streams closed. Ambient temperatures shall be maintained at 308 K $ 2 K (35 $ 2 °C)[309 K $ 2 K (36 $ 2 °C) throughout the 4-hour period mentioned below.\n2.2.3.The enclosure may be sealed and the mixing fan operated for a period of up to 12 hours before the 4-hour background sampling period begins.\n2.2.4.The analyser (if required) shall be calibrated, then zeroed and spanned.\n2.2.5.The enclosure shall be purged until a stable hydrocarbon reading is obtained, and the mixing fan turned on if not already on.\n2.2.6.The chamber is then sealed and the background hydrocarbon concentration, temperature and barometric pressure are measured.  These are the initial readingsCHCi, Pi, Ti used in the enclosure background calculation.\n2.2.7.The enclosure is allowed to stand undisturbed with the mixing fan on for a period of four hours.\n2.2.8.At the end of this time the same analyser is used to measure the hydrocarbon concentration in the chamber.  The temperature and the barometric pressure arealso measured.  These are the final readings CHCf, Pf, Tf.\n2.2.9.The change in mass of hydrocarbons in the enclosure shall be calculated over the time of the test in accordance with paragraph 2.4. below and shallnot exceed 0.05 g.\n2.3.Calibration and hydrocarbon retention test of the chamber The calibration and hydrocarbon retention test in the chamber provides a check onthe calculated volume in paragraph 2.1. above and also measures any leak rate.\nThe enclosure leak rate shall be determined at the enclosure's introduction toservice, after any operations in the enclosure which may affect the integrity of theenclosure, and at least monthly thereafter.  If six consecutive monthly retentionchecks are successfully completed without corrective action, the enclosure leakrate may be determined quarterly thereafter as long as no corrective action isrequired.\n2.3.1.The enclosure shall be purged until a stable hydrocarbon concentration is reached. The mixing fan is turned on, if not already switched on.  The hydrocarbonanalyser is zeroed, calibrated if required, and spanned.\n2.3.2.On variable-volume enclosures, the enclosure shall be latched to the nominal volume position.  On fixed-volume enclosures the outlet and inlet flow streamsshall be closed.\n2.3.3.The ambient temperature control system is then turned on (if not already on) and adjusted for an initial temperature of 308 K (35 °C) [309 K (36 °C)].\n2.3.4.When the enclosure stabilises at 308 K $ 2 K (35 $ 2 °C) [309 K $ 2 K (36 $ 2 °C)], the enclosure is sealed and the backgroundconcentration, temperature and barometric pressure measured. These are the initialreadings CHCi, Pi, Ti used in the enclosure calibration.\n2.3.5.A quantity of approximately 4 grams of propane is injected into the enclosure. The mass of propane shall be measured to an accuracy and precision of $ 2 percent of the measured value.\n2.3.6.The contents of the chamber shall be allowed to mix for five minutes and then the hydrocarbon concentration, temperature and barometric pressure are measured.\nThese are the readings CHCf, Pf, Tf for the calibration of the enclosure as well asthe initial readings CHCi, Pi, Ti for the retention check.\n2.3.7.Based on the readings taken according to paragraphs 2.3.4. and 2.3.6. above and the formula in paragraph 2.4. below, the mass of propane in the enclosure iscalculated. This shall be within  ± 2 per cent of the mass of propane measured inparagraph 2.3.5. above.\n2.3.8.For variable-volume enclosures the enclosure shall be unlatched from the nominal volume configuration. For fixed-volume enclosures, the outlet and inlet flowstreams shall be opened.\n2.3.9.The process is then begun of cycling the ambient temperature from 308 K (35 °C) to 293 K (20 °C) and back to 308 K (35 °C) [308.6 K (35.6 °C) to 295.2 K (22.2 °C) and back to 308.6 K (35.6 °C)] over a 24-hour period according to the profile [alternative profile] specified in Appendix 2 to this annex within",

Propane inair should be used to optimise the response on the most common operating range.\n3.2.Calibration of the HC analyser The analyser should be calibrated using propane in air and purified synthetic air.\nSee paragraph 4.5.2. of Annex 4 (Calibration and span gases).\nEstablish a calibration curve as described in paragraphs 4.1. to 4.5. of thisappendix.\n3.3.Oxygen interference check and recommended limits The response factor (Rf) for a particular hydrocarbon species is the ratio of the FID C1 reading to the gas cylinder concentration, expressed as ppm C1.  The concentration of the test gas shall be at a level to give a response of approximately 80 per cent of full-scale deflection, for the operating range. The concentration shall be known, to an accuracy of $ 2 per cent in reference to a gravimetric standard expressed in volume. In addition the gas cylinder shall be preconditioned for 24 hours at a temperature between 293 K and 303 K (20 and\n30°C). Response factors should be determined when introducing an analyser into serviceand thereafter at major service intervals. The reference gas to be used is propanewith balance purified air which is taken to give a response factor of 1.00.\nThe test gas to be used for oxygen interference and the recommended responsefactor range are given below:\nPropane and nitrogen:       0.95 % Rf ³  1.05.\n4.CALIBRATION OF THE HYDROCARBON ANALYZER Each of the normally used operating ranges are calibrated by the followingprocedure:\n4.1.Establish the calibration curve by at least five calibration points spaced as evenly as possible over the operating range.  The nominal concentration of the calibrationgas with the highest concentrations to be at least 80 per cent of the full scale.\nE/ECE/TRANS/505 Regulation No.83 page 201 Annex 4 – Appendix 7\n4.2.Calculate the calibration curve by the method of least squares.  If the resulting polynomial degree is greater than 3, then the number of calibration points shall beat least the number of the polynomial degree plus 2.\n4.3.The calibration curve shall not differ by more than 2 per cent from the nominal value of each calibration gas.\n4.4.Using the coefficients of the polynomial derived from paragraph 3.2. above, a table of indicated reading against true concentration shall be drawn up in steps ofno greater than 1 per cent of full scale.  This is to be carried out for each analyserrange calibrated.  The table shall also contain other relevant data such as:\n(a) date of calibration, span and zero potentiometer readings (whereapplicable),(b) nominal scale,(c) reference data of each calibration gas used,(d) the actual and indicated value of each calibration gas used together withthe percentage differences,(e) FID fuel and type,(f) FID air pressure.\n4.5.If it can be shown to the satisfaction of the technical service that alternative technology (e.g. computer, electronically controlled range switch) can giveequivalent accuracy, then those alternatives may be used.\nAnnex 7 - Appendix 2Diurnal ambient temperature profilefor the calibration of the enclosureand the diurnal emission testAlternative diurnal ambienttemperature profile for thecalibration of the enclosurein accordance with Annex 7,Appendix 1, paragraphs 1.2.\nand 2.3.9.\nTime (hours)Calibration\nTest\nTemperature\n(°Ci)Time (hours)Temperature\n(°Ci)13\n0/24 20.0 035.614\n1 20.2 135.315\n2 20.5 234.516\n3 21.2 333.217\n4 23.1 431.418\n5 25.1 529.719\n6 27.2 628.220\n7 29.8 727.221\n8 31.8 826.122\n9 33.3 925.123\n10 34.4 1024.324/011 35.0 1123.71\n12 34.7 1223.32\n13 33.8 1322.93\n14 32.0 1422.64\n15 30.0 1522.25\n16 28.4 1622.56\n17 26.9 1724.27\n18 25.2 1826.88\n19 24.0 1929.69\n20 23.0 2031.910\n21 22.0 2133.911\n22 20.8 2235.112\n23 20.2 2335.424\n35.6 E/ECE/TRANS/505 Regulation No.83 page 203 Annex 7 – Appendix 2",

If this is the case, the vehicle must be drivenuntil the end of the regeneration.  If a regeneration occurs during the emissionsmeasurement, a new test (including preconditioning) shall be performed, and the firstresult not taken into account.\nAll exhaust emissions results shall be plotted as a function of the running distance onthe system rounded to the nearest kilometre and the best fit straight line fitted by themethod of least squares shall be drawn through all these data points. This calculationshall not take into account the test results at 0 km.\nThe data will be acceptable for use in the calculation of the deterioration factor onlyif the interpolated 6,400 km and 80,000 km points on this line are within the abovementioned limits.\nThe data are still acceptable when a best fit straight line crosses an applicable limitwith a negative slope (the 6,400 km interpolated point is higher than the 80,000 kminterpolated point) but the 80,000 km actual data point is below the limit.\nAmultiplicative exhaust emission deterioration factor shall be calculated for each pollutant as follows:\nwhere:\nMi1 = mass emission of the pollutant i in g/km interpolated to 6,400 km,Mi2  = mass emission of the pollutant i in g/km interpolated to 80,000 km.\nThese interpolated values shall be carried out to a minimum of four places to theright of the decimal point before dividing one by the other to determine thedeterioration factor.  The result shall be rounded to three places to the right of thedecimal point.\nIf a deterioration factor is less than one, it is deemed to be equal to one.\nE/ECE/TRANS/505 Regulation No.83 page 217 Annex 7 – Appendix 2",

The procedure describes a method for checking the function of the on-board diagnostic (OBD) system installed on the vehicle by failure simulation ofrelevant systems in the engine management or emission control system. It also setsprocedures for determining the durability of OBD systems.\nThe manufacturer shall make available the defective components and/or electricaldevices which would be used to simulate failures. When measured over the Type Itest cycle, such defective components or devices shall not cause the vehicleemissions to exceed the limits of paragraph 3.3.2. by more than 20 per cent.\nWhen the vehicle is tested with the defective component or device fitted, the OBDsystem is approved if the MI is activated.  The OBD system is also approved if theMI is activated below the OBD threshold limits.\n2.DESCRIPTION OF TEST\n2.1.The testing of OBD systems consists of the following phases:\n2.1.1.simulation of malfunction of a component of the engine management or emission control system,\n2.1.2.preconditioning of the vehicle with a simulated malfunction over preconditioning specified in paragraph 6.2.1. or paragraph 6.2.2.\n2.1.3.driving the vehicle with a simulated malfunction over the Type I test cycle and measuring the emissions of the vehicle,\n2.1.4.determining whether the OBD system reacts to the simulated malfunction and indicates malfunction in an appropriate manner to the vehicle driver.\n2.2.Alternatively, at the request of the manufacturer, malfunction of one or more components may be electronically simulated according to the requirements ofparagraph 6. below.\n2.3.Manufacturers may request that monitoring take place outside the Type I test cycle if it can be demonstrated to the authority that monitoring during conditionsencountered during the Type I test cycle would impose restrictive monitoringconditions when the vehicle is used in service.\nE/ECE/TRANS/505 Regulation No.83 page 243 Annex 7 – Appendix 2\n3.TEST VEHICLE AND FUEL\n3.1.Vehicle The test vehicle shall meet the requirements of paragraph 3.1. of Annex 4.\n3.2.Fuel The appropriate reference fuel as described in Annex 10 for petrol and diesel fuelsand in Annex 10a for LPG and NG fuels must be used for testing.  The fuel type foreach failure mode to be tested (described in paragraph 6.3. of this appendix) maybe selected by the administrative department from the reference fuels described inAnnex 10a in the case of the testing of a mono-fuelled gas vehicle and from thereference fuels described in Annex 10 or Annex 10a in the case of the testing of abi-fuelled gas vehicle.  The selected fuel type must not be changed during any ofthe test phases (described in paragraphs 2.1. to 2.3. of this appendix).  In the case ofthe use of LPG or NG as a fuel it is permissible that the engine is started on petroland switched to LPG or NG after a pre-determined period of time which iscontrolled automatically and not under the control of the driver.\n4.TEST TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE\n4.1.The test temperature and pressure shall meet the requirements of the Type I test as described in Annex 4.\n5.TEST EQUIPMENT\n5.1.Chassis dynamometer The chassis dynamometer shall meet the requirements of Annex 4.",
